About Me

My name is Dan Riches and I am a Software Test Engineer and Web Developer located in Southern California. I write code for test automation using JavaScript and Cypress, and I also develop web sites and applications. I love Web Development and Test Automation because there is always something to learn, and well.... it's fun too.

When I'm not coding, automating a test, or learning something new about coding or test automation then I might be found drinking coffee, playing video games, cooking, or playing the guitar.


Experience
My past experience includes over 10 years of working in application development alongside developers and designers as a Quality Assurance Analyst. I've been writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for over 10 years and also have been involved in Test Automation during that time.
